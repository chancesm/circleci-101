# circleci-101

## Details
This is my first full DevOps Pipeline!
GitHub -> CircleCI -> DockerHub -> AWS

## Status
Finished the Docker Hub setup today!
The code currently triggers a Docker Hub build once tests are passed on CircleCI!

- [x] - Create Basic application in GitHub Repo
- [x] - Create Tests that will run with "yarn test"
- [x] - Configure CircleCI to run tests on GitHub commit
- [x] - Set up Docker Hub with a trigger that builds the Docker Image
- [x] - Configure CircleCI to call Docker Hub Trigger on successful test
- [ ] - Set up Deployment to AWS
